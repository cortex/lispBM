# Chapter 2: List processing

This chapter is all about getting familiar with lists. Lists are 
of course a very important concept to get quite well familiarised with 
as in Lisp we express our code and data using this construct. 

In this chapter the programs will start to become slightly larger and 
will be written into files and loaded into the REPL. All examples are 
available [here](./ch2_examples).
